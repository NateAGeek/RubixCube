## Problem

```
Hey Nate,

Below is Cube's coding test.

Please return by Monday EOD.

Frontend 

Build a representation of a rubiks cube state on a web app. It must support the ability to do rotations of faces and display the current cube color state. The interface for rotation can be as simple as it needs to be. e.g it can be 6 buttons that select the face to rotate and a toggle for which direction. Your code should: - Emphasize correctness, readability, and maintainability - In areas with complex logic, be either self-documenting or documented - Leverage good, modern language practices

For specifics of display and rotation, you can refer to a rubiks cube. For illustration, given an initial state of...

## First thought, dope coding test problem ;)

Tickeled my graphical programming side of my brain, and want to store the whole cube state in a $(n \times n) \times 4$ matrix or similar (maybe $2n \times 2n) \times 1$ ) and then apply rotational transforms for switching the the sub faces of the cube face. I am first going to resolve the basic math side of things, then simply make some functions and a state type. Then I need to encode the proper symbols and read up on my transforms. make some good debugging functions to print out the cube correctly. Finally I need to decide if I am going to use CSS3 and transforms for projection display or use three.js for display... Really tempted to look up if someone has done a bit of what I am thinking, I'm sure it is in some llm lol. But imma try to just use my mathy brain first to make a solution.

### After looking online

Seems like a good representation of a cube, did not realize the faces were coded as up, down, left, right, front, back. I do remember watching a youtube video a bit back about the algo to solve. Might be a cool bonus.

## Game Plan
Make the cube data structure (might research if there is any good representation online for face ordering) then make some debugging statements to quickly display the cube.
