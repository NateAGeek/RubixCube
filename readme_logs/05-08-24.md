## Gonna actually start coding

[Wiki on Matrix Rotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix)
Slight review on matrix rotations. However, these are for vectors in 3D space, I do think I might be able to apply 2D rotations on individual faces with 90 degree rotations... I think I'll start by implementing just a matrix with F, R, U, L, D, B faces and see how that goes.

Base on the wiki page there does appear to be face specific rotations. Gonna create an enum and see if I can get a simple rotation to work.
