# Actually coded stuff...
Actually wrapped up the debugging functions and cleared up a minor misconception of the matrix data. Gonna test the matrix rotations.

# Was hoping for magic matrix
I was kinda hoping for a magic matrix that could to the 90 degree rotation in all one process, reviewing a bit more of linear algebra... I think I was use to working more in 3D where I can do quaternion/rotation matrixes and magic single op rotations. I was thinking on making all my items vec2 and then doing some weird things, but that might become harder to interpret.

# Stuck on the Row Col swaps
I know how to do the swaps, more of how do I easily setup, maybe specific order?, the data structure to easily get the adjacent faces to a selected face. I think I am going to go and work on the visual aspect of the app for now.
